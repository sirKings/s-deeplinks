This is a blank Ionic2 application to test integration with branch.io.

To test in a browser: ionic cordova run browser

# Functionality

Step 1:

* App shows payload input field and submit button.
* User enters payload text and submits.
* App calls: url = make_deeplink_url(payload) <<< deliverable, see home.ts
* App shows and logs the URL
* User shares the URL with another user

Step 2:

* Another user receives the URL and opens it on a mobile device
* If application is not installed on the mobile device, app store page opens
* If application is installed on the mobile device, it starts
* App calls: text = get_deeplink_payload() <<< deliverable, see home.ts
* App shows text saying: "Received Deeplink Payload: {{text}}"

The last step is expected to work correctly in following cases:

* App is freshly installed from referral URL: get_deeplink_payload() returns payload text
* App is launched via referral URL: get_deeplink_payload() returns text from that URL
* App is manually launched: get_deeplink_payload() returns nothing

For deeplink to be resolved correctly in case of fresh install app needs to be deployed in real appstores.


Check the config.xml file. The branch.io sdk was added and <branch-config> tag was added too. The information can be found on your branch.io dashboard. You will need to update that.
